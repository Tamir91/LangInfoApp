    <string name="java">Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent,
        class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation
        dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run
        anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support
        Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to
        bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.
        As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use,
        particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
        Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been
        acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun
        Microsystems Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it
        has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

    <string name="ruby">Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming
        language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in
        Japan.

        According to its creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp.
        It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and
        imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.

    <string name="javaScript">JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a
        high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, object-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming
        language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World
        Wide Web content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online
        programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web
        browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine.
        Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of JavaScript, all
        based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and
        with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.

    <string name="PHP">PHP is a server-side scripting language designed primarily for web development
        but also used as a general-purpose programming language. Originally created by Rasmus
        Lerdorf in 1994, the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Development
        Team. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive
        acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.

        PHP code may be embedded into HTML or HTML5 markup, or it can be used in combination with
        various web template systems, web content management systems and web frameworks. PHP code is
        usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a
        Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server software combines the results of
        the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with
        the generated web page. PHP code may also be executed with a command-line interface (CLI)
        and can be used to implement standalone graphical applications.
